Exoskeleton is a Scala library to make it easy to write command-line applications, in particular those which
need argument parsing, and tab completions, making it trivial to write interactive command-line applications in
Scala. Tab completions are automatically provided for [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) and [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/).
