# Exoskeleton

Exoskeleton is a Scala library for to make it easy to write command-line applications which
interact through tab-completion in
[`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) and [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/) by
implementing a simple,
[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) API to
define the execution of parameters.

## Features

- unified programmatic tab-completions for `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`
- automatic installation of completion scripts for each shell
- tab-completions can be generated programmatically on-demand
- high-level APIs for programs following common tab-completion patterns
- low-level APIs for more fine-grained control over completions
- fully functional API
- can be used with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) to eliminate JVM
  startup time


## Getting Started

Exoskeleton provides the `Application` trait, akin to `App` in the Scala
Standard Library. In addition to a `main` method, the `Application` trait
defines a `complete` method, which should be implemented to return a sequence
of tab-completions based on the current state of the command-line, which is
passed in as an input parameter.

### Explanation

For a shell to offer tab-completions for a command to the user, it needs to
find definitions for the possible ways of completing the arguments to that
command. In general, this is done by searching a sequence of possible
locations for a file with a predictable name based on the command name (e.g.
for `cmd`, this file will be called `_cmd` or `cmd.fish`). These locations
are usually defined in an environment variable, containing at least some
default initial values, but potentially with additional paths added to it
during the shell startup script, e.g. `.bashrc` for `bash`.

The way a completion script works will be different for every shell, because
their tab-completion systems all work differently, but each shell typically
provides a command for specifying command completions which will be called
from the completion script. Completion scripts for most commands define a
static set of completions (which may be dependent on the state of the
command-line being completed).

Exoskeleton, however, defines very general completion scripts for each shell
it supports, which all run the command whose parameters are being completed
in “completion mode”, effectively calling the Exoskeleton application’s
`complete` method. The completion scripts receive a response from the
Exoskeleton application, in aformat that is specific to each shell, which is
transformed into calls to the completion command for that particular shell.

### Generation of completion scripts

Source files may be generated by running,
```shell
java -cp exoskeleton.jar exoskeleton.Generate <shell> <command> <dir>
```
where _shell_ is one of `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`, _command_ is the name of
the command that completions are being provided for, and _dir_ is the
directory in which the script should be written.

No other _Niveau_ libraries are dependents of _Exoskeleton_.

## Status

Exoskeleton is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Exoskeleton is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists of 324 lines of code.

## Building

Exoskeleton can be built on Linux or Mac OS with Vex, by running the `vex` script in the root directory:
```sh
./vex
```

This script will download `vex` the first time it is run, start a daemon process, and run the build. Subsequent
invocations will be near-instantaneous.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions. While it can be tempting to repsond to
such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider audience, and it can result in duplication of
effort.
